## About Me

I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Department of Ctr-Secure AI for Healthcare](https://sbmi.uth.edu/safe/) at The [University of Texas Health Science, Houston](https://www.uth.edu/), working under the supervision of [Dr. Xiaoqian Jiang](https://sbmi.uth.edu/faculty-and-staff/xiaoqian-jiang.htm). Prior to this, I completed my PhD in Computer Science at the [University of Alabama at Birmingham](https://www.uab.edu/home/), where I had the honor of working with [Dr. Qing Tian](https://qtianreal.github.io/). My primary research interests lie in Computer Vision and Machine Learning, with a focus on AI model compression (including knowledge distillation and pruning), autonomous driving perception, and adversarial robustness. Recently, my work has also expanded into Medical AI, large-scale vision models, and multi-modal learning frameworks, driven by the growing demand for scalable and generalizable AI systems in complex real-world environments.


I am happy to collaborate and/or answer questions about my research and my previous study at UAB and current experience at UTHealth. If you are interested in research collaboration or have any inquiries about my experience, please send me an email.
